### SQL-project-WCS
SQL requests of my first team project in WCS

Our very first project in the Wild Code School was a data visualization and SQL project where we had to create a dashboard with KPI for a imaginary toys company. 
I will present here the SQL part of this project as I was specifically in charge of that part meaning that I have written, rewritten or reviewed all the requests we have used in the project presentation.
